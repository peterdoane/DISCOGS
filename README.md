# DISCOGS

My project is called DiscoGopher. It seeks to help record collectors accurately catalog their collection and display it in a pleasing way. The primary use case would be the user entering a UPC code to get the exact record, entering the condition and saving to his collection. Record Collectors who buy and sell a lot of records on Discogs struggle with uploading text and also the way it displays there records is very boring and ugly. So I seek to make a better looking way to look at a users collection. This can help the users buy and sell records.

I used the discogs API. I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Materialize, jQuery and underscore.js.

My design review was very helpful in getting some actionable steps as to what was most important. I had a mockup i wanted it to look like but because of structuring issues it was difficult and I had to go with just making the most important changes.

The thing I struggled with the most in the start was finding the data I wanted from the APIs. Then getting it display and figuring out all the changes in State was very difficult. Then in the end because I didn't structure the HTML in a way I understood from the start, I had way too many rows and containers so that when I went to restructure things it was very difficult to see what was where.

Also the way I wrote and named the functions made it difficult to figure out what was going on when I wanted to make changes.
